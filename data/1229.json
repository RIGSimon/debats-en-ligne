We no longer live in hunter gather societies and therefore dietary custom is an antiquated justification for meat consumption. Hunter gatherer meat consumption is more justified than agrarian meat consumption because meat was a scarcity that had to be earned; consequently it was the highlight of the meal. The amount of meat consumed is unnatural and is therefore at odds with the foundation of this cultural argument.",

The latter was very much a running game: When distant, circling vultures tipped them off about a lion kill, they had to get there before hyenas, which strip everything edible from carcasses. And they typically could only outrace hyenas in the hot sun. As a result, they carved out a new carnivore niche: the hot-day meat chaser.), which is likely to have been an advantage over other predators when hunting.",

One has to keep in mind that not only the production affects the environment - to get the product from the farm to your nearest store one needs transportation. Vegetables are in general less \\(calorie/nutrient\\)-dense and therefore you need a bigger volume of them to feed people.",

The main problem with farming practice in terms of its environmental impact, really isn't the consumption of meat, but the immoral inclinations of free markets. There are for example solutions that help resolve issues with scale, run off, green house. Free markets do not play by ethics. Same is true of agriculture.",
